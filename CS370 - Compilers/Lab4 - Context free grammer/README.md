Project Name: Lab4
Requirements met:
I updated the context free grammar to read in variables. Updated the lex program
to allow more complex variable names and not just a single letter. Implemented the
union type in lex to allow lex to return chars and integers. Defined each token to
be an INTEGER, VARIABLE, INT or expr stat. Copied the yyval.ID from lex so that yacc
has a copy when a variable matches. Inserted semantic directive c code in the symtab.
The programs no are all able to communicate together.
