# input: a number to determine the size of the matrix
# output: the time it take to preform gaussian elimination on the matrix
# problem: The task is to create a program that can generate an matrix with random entires
#           and preform gaussian elimination and backsubstitution on the matrix. The goal
#           was to time how long it would take to solve the matrix for each increase in size
