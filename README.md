### CS370 - Compilers
**Project:** Algol C Compiler

This course focused on compiler design, covering topics from lexical analysis to code generation. Labs included pattern detection with lex and yacc, constructing a symbol table, building an Abstract Syntax Tree, and generating MIPS assembly, which all come together to create a functioning compiler.
